# Whiteboarding Practice

#### By Jase Seeley

#### Epicodus Week #15 Independent Code Review: Whiteboarding Mock Interview

* Practice with 5 whiteboarding prompts before mock interview with peers.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* VS Code

## Description

We had 6 hours to solve 5 whiteboarding prompts before performing a mock interview with our peers. Some prompts had specific stipulations for which methods could or could not be used. If time allowed, we were asked to solve certain prompts again with recursion or a specified method. We were randomly assigned a prompt to whiteboard shortly before our interview. The "whiteboardingSolution.txt" file is the code written during my interview.
